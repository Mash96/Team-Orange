	<h1>common reactions to Sexual assualt</h1>

	<div class="panelL">
		<p> a person may experience one emotion one day and the opposite reaction the next. For example, a survivor may feel the desire to isolate and be alone, but later fear being left alone.Listed below are some common reactions to sexual assault. Because everyone reacts to trauma differently, it is important to remember that reactions listed and not listed are both normal.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Frozen Fright: During a sexual assault, some people “freeze” or “tense up” and are unable to move. This is physiological response that our bodies use to survive a life threatening situation and is completely normal.</li>
			<li>Dissociation: this occurs during trauma when the mind tries to separate from the trauma occurring on the body. During an assault, a victim may dissociate by focusing on the details of a wallpaper pattern or reciting poems in their head. After an assault, many people report feeling that they are in a dream-like state</li>
