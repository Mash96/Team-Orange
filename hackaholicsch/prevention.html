		<h3>Prevent sexual harassment on campus<h3>
			<p>Along with taking the measures suggested for workplace and high school harassment prevention, students should be educated about their rights. Students should file a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights if their harassment is not being taken seriously by administrators, or if they are forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to report harassment.</p>

		<h3>Insist on respect from friends and partners <h3>
			<p>  Sexual harassment is any unwanted sexual or sex-discriminatory behavior. It doesn't just happen in the workplace.[16] It can come from friends, partners, and exes. If any of your friends make unwanted sexist or sexual comments about you or your other friends, tell them to stop.
						Explain how you feel to your other friends. Listen to how they feel.
						If your friends persist in disrespecting you, refuse to hang out with them.</p>
